## What is ORMIR-MIDS?

Musculoskeletal (MSK) imaging data can be **structured in various ways**, depending on institutional, group, or personal preferences. 

Having a **standardized data structure** is highly desirable to **facilitate data sharing** and to provide a **common interface for processing and analysis software** to read and write data in an interoperable way 

Currently, **there is no defined standard** on how the MSK imaging data should be structured. 

Inspired by the Brain Imaging Data Structure ([BIDS](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/index.html)) tools, the **[ORMIR](https://www.ormir.org/) community is creating ORMIR-MIDS** to structure MSK imaging data


ORMIR-MIDS includes two aspects:

## Why is ORMIR-MIDS important for MSK computational tools?


We want to have a **uniform interface** for software tools for MSK image processing and analysis.   
Ideally, each tool will have a command-line interface with the following syntax:

```
msk_software_tool <patient_folder>
```
where `patient_folder` is the *location of the root (or parent) folder* containing the acquired data, structured according to the ORMIR-MIDS standard specification

The MSK tools should also **output data in the correct format** in the same folder structure

:::{admonition} Why the name ORMIR-MIDS? How did ORMIR-MIDS start?
:class: hint
:class: dropdown

*ORMIR-MIDS* comes from ORMIR (Open and Reproducible Musculoskeletal Imaging Research (ORMIR) community and *MIDS*  (Medical Imaging Data Structure)

The development of ORMIR-MIDS specification and package started during the 2nd [ORMIR](https://ormircommunity.github.io/) workshop [Sharing and Curating Open Data in Musculoskeletal Imaging Research](https://github.com/ORMIRcommunity/2024_2nd_ORMIR_WS/blob/main/README.md) and is currently ongoing. 

ORMIR-MIDS is an extension of [muscle-BIDS](https://github.com/muscle-bids/muscle-bids), which was partly developed during the 1st [ORMIR](https://ormircommunity.github.io/) workshop [Building the Jupyter Community in Musculoskeletal Imaging Research](https://github.com/JCMSK/2022_JCW/blob/main/README.md). 

Both [ORMIR-MIDS](https://github.com/ormir-mids/ormir-mids) and [muscle-BIDS](https://github.com/muscle-bids/muscle-bids) are part of the [ORMIR](https://ormircommunity.github.io/) community core projects.
