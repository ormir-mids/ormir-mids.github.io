To aid the conversion and the implementation of the ORMIR-MIDS standard, we are working on a Python package that identifies the correct scan types from DICOM datasets and appropriately converts them. Additionally, the package provides functions for the I/O of ORMIR-MIDS datasets in Python programs, providing functions to identify the desired scan type, read header fields, etc.


# Python resources
