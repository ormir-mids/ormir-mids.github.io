# ORMIR-MIDS as a Python Package

We are working on a Python package to implement the conversion between DICOM and ORMIR-MIDS data structure. You can find it on [GitHub](https://github.com/ormir-mids/ormir-mids)


The package provides also functions for the input/output of ORMIR-MIDS datasets in Python programs, including functions to identify the desired scan type, read header fields, etc.

To learn how to use and contribute to ORMIR-MIDS, refer to the [Read Me](https://github.com/ormir-mids/ormir-mids/blob/main/README.md) file in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ormir-mids/ormir-mids)
